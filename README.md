A Remote health monitoring system is an 
extension of a hospital medical system where a patient’s vital 
body state can be monitored remotely. The main objective of the 
project was to design a remote healthcare system. It’s comprised 
of three main parts. The first part being, detection of patient’s 
vitals using sensors, second for sending data to cloud storage and 
the last part was providing the detected data for remote viewing. 
Remote viewing of the data enables a doctor or guardian to 
monitor a patient’s health progress away from hospital 
premises. The aim of the project was to come up with a 
Healthcare Monitoring System that can be made with locally 
available sensors with a view to making it affordable if it were 
to be mass produced. Designing a Health Monitoring System 
which has heartbeat detection system, temperature detection 
system, air quality detection system and SPO2 detection system. 
The system was to collect a heartbeat detection system data, 
SpO2 detection system data, temperature data and few other 
parameters. The data from the single parameter monitoring 
systems was then availed for remote detection.
